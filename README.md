# Portal Watchface

**Cave Johnson here!** Listen up, test subjects. We’ve got something new from the Aperture Science labs that’s going to blow your mind. Introducing the **Aperture Science Smartwatch Watchface**. This isn’t just any watchface; it’s a **quantum leap in timekeeping technology**.

**WARNING:** Side effects may include increased productivity, spontaneous bursts of genius, and an uncontrollable urge to test the limits of human endurance. If you experience any of these symptoms, congratulations! You’re doing science right.

## Features

Now, let’s talk features. This watchface isn’t just about telling time. It’s about **dominating time**. With precision down to the nanosecond, you’ll never be late for another test chamber again. The features include:
- **Time**: Because knowing when to test is crucial.
- **Date**: Keep track of your testing schedule.
- **Battery**: Monitor your power levels. Don’t want to run out of juice mid-experiment.
- **Current Weather**: Know if it's raining acid or just normal rain.
- **Step Counter**: Track your steps. Every step is a step closer to science.

- **Portal 1**: Classic, clean, and ready for testing.
- **Portal 2**: Weathered down look.

To switch between the styles, simply tap anywhere on the watchface. The dark style is always used as AOD.
